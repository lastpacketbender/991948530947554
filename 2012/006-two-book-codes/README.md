# Two book codes

Using the outguess messages from the two images, two books were 
deduced for the book codes.

## Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 6, Slice 3 "Chitrai" to "Cincinnati"

```
In twenty-nine volumes, knowledge was once contained.
How many lines of the code remained when the Mabinogion paused?
Go that far in from the beginning and find my first name.
```

Mabinogion code paused at line 69 out of a total of 75 in the `r/a2e7j6ic78h0j` subreddit for about 24 hours, then posting continued. 6 from the beginning is Volume 6 - "cicada" is my first name. For this puzzle, the first line is 0-indexed.

The volume can be found in [31447.txt](books/31447.txt) and code to solve it in [encyclopedia-britannica.py].

The end result is `eq6emgv2ehsrix6t.onion`.

## Agrippa

```
A poem of fading death, named for a king
Meant to be read only once and vanish
Alas, it could not remain unseen.
```

- `named for a king` - Herod Agrippa was king of Judea from AD 41 to 44.
- `a poem of fading death`, `meant to be read only once and vanish`, `alas, it could not remain unseen` - these are all references to the thematic material and uncovering of William Gibson's poem *Agrippa*
