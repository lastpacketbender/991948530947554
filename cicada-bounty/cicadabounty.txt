Comments:
 - So-called "Duplicate Key" examples with the same keyid (see above) are preferred
   since many have claimed these exist / can be created. (No 'duplicate keys' are known to exist)
 - However, abusing new GPG exploits will be accepted (and immediately responsibly disclosed to GPG).
 - Warnings related to the key being trusted during peer verification may be overlooked as they are dependent on individual gpg configuration
 - The following text is recommended as your message (with newlines) but not necessarily required.
