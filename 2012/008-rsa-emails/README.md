# RSA E-mails

After submitting their email to `sq6wmgv2zcsrix6t.onion`, players received an email from `c99194853094755497@gmail.com` containing a number, following Cicada's instructions they visited `sq6wmgv2zcsrix6t.onion/NUM`. It was served only once per number.

## Challenge

There are several versions of this I was able to find, below is the only one with a valid PGP signature from Cicada due to redactions in the others.

See [quaetrix0@gmail.com.asc](quaetrix0@gmail.com.asc). [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20121231040539/http://pastebin.com/4YaQ0TvJ)

Here is a message that has been encrypted with RSA (the Crypt::RSA Perl module available in CPAN) :

- -----BEGIN COMPRESSED RSA ENCRYPTED MESSAGE-----
Version: 1.99
Scheme: Crypt::RSA::ES::OAEP

- -----END COMPRESSED RSA ENCRYPTED MESSAGE-----


Here is the public key used to encrypt it. Note that it has a low bit modulus and is therefore breakable:

$VAR1 = bless( {
                 'e' => 65537,
                 'n' => '7880891639791153779530258464649693928733411681581577103690292822333198036864739065916344030512697162068582555837',
                 'Version' => '1.99',
                 'Identity' => '<quaetrix0@gmail.com>'
               }, 'Crypt::RSA::Key::Public' );


The encrypted message is a number.  Break the decryption key, then come back to this same URL and enter the 
decrypted message to continue.  Each person who has come this far has received a unique message encrypted 
with a unique key.  You are not to collaborate.  Sharing your message or key will result in not receiving 
the next step.

There is a second chance to get your own RSA message and key.  Follow the "Numbers dot TK" hint to find it.

There are many fake messages out there.  Only messages signed with public key ID 7A35090F are valid.  

Good luck.

### Factoring

In order to solve this challenge, `n` must be factored into its two primes `p` and `q`. 

This may be done in one of several ways, but depends on the distance between `p` and `q`. The first method (and one commonly used with participants) is a general number field sieve (GNFS). A second potential candidate is fermat factorization, although I have not personally attempted it. If the primes are close to one another, this is another way to factor within a lifetime - and possibly much quicker than sieving.

Reference [factor.sh](factor.sh) (pass the script `n`, it will take ~1 hour on modern hardware) for factoring method used. Personally, I used cado-nfs as msieve is dated and certain components don't compile well against modern hardware. Have fun attempting to get CUDA to run if you choose this path.

After factorization is complete, you are presented with the following `p` and `q` (see [quaetrix0@gmail.com.factors](./quaetrix0%40gmail.com.factors)):

```
98007492061325958997349177934627388613835953553459586261 80411114232571782218163489375797613948878398942588985417
```

### Key reconstruction/decryption

In order to retrieve the message from the compressed RSA method, the private key needs to be recreated. Now that we have `p` and `q`, we can use the same `Crypt::RSA` module to do the heavy lifting (no need to compute inverse-mod, etc.).

First, there is some prep-work. We need to isolate the RSA encrypted message from the rest of the PGP-signed message. This involves removing the prepended `- ` from the armor. See [quaetrix0@gmail.com.pem](./quaetrix0%40gmail.com.pem) for reference.

See [recreate-pk-decrypt.pl](recreate-pk-decrypt.pl) for reference. It takes 4 arguments: `p`, `q`, identity for naming output file, and the RSA encrypted message. See example usage below.

`./recreate-pk-decrypt.pl 98007492061325958997349177934627388613835953553459586261 80411114232571782218163489375797613948878398942588985417 quaetrix0@gmail.com "$(cat quaetrix0@gmail.com.pem)"`

This will recreate the key (see [quaetrix0@gmail.com.private](quaetrix0@gmail.com.private)), it will look like the following:

```
$VAR1 = bless( {
                 'Checked' => 1,
                 'private' => {
                                '_dq' => '62101227333680030901477437955149311570693368388546911025',
                                '_phi' => '7880891639791153779530258464649693928733411681581577103511874216039300295649226398605919027949982809572533984160',
                                '_u' => '4348205097514343307003508663178692051409656423708745886',
                                '_n' => '7880891639791153779530258464649693928733411681581577103690292822333198036864739065916344030512697162068582555837',
                                '_d' => '3539228264069658941348163131232277823374304173402947606856607442001749947381601711457183100090390070514958271233',
                                '_e' => '65537',
                                '_p' => '98007492061325958997349177934627388613835953553459586261',
                                '_q' => '80411114232571782218163489375797613948878398942588985417',
                                '_dp' => '32650221617939937177306324699737854579945380074350109813'
                              },
                 'Version' => '1.99',
                 'Cipher' => 'Blowfish'
               }, 'Crypt::RSA::Key::Private' );
```
Upon successful decryption after the script runs, you should now have the following plaintext: `33521494043430258676`.

### Solves for other known `n`

Just like the `quaetrix0@gmail.com` solve above, this directory contains all instances of these RSA challenges I was able to find. You may run them all by using [decrypt.sh](decrypt.sh). 

All intermediate files created in the solve above can also be found in this directory for each of the unknown identities. Their plaintexts are the following: `29201928111913239376` and `25121996842107342310`. 

Due to redaction of these emails, the Cicada signature will report bad when verified. For that reason - the above solve is the one listed. It's contents can be verified via signature.

### Submission

When the RSA encrypted message was broken, solvers headed back to the same number URL and submitted the message. Initially, it resulted in a 500 error.

![500_error.webp](500_error.webp)

On the 17th of January around 2:49 UTC, it succeeded.

```
Correct. Weâ€™ll email you.
