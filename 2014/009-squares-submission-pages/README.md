# Squares submission pages

After [submitting the squares and hidden service URL](../008-sixth-onion/README.md#submission), three more Liber Primus pages were given.

## Runes

The first two pages of runes are encrypted with the Vigenere key `FIRFUMFERENFE`. Like the "Warning" page, the key skips on some of the `áš ` runes and continues after it. The first two pages must be decrypted as one, the key continues onto the next page. The third page is unencrypted. See [gematriaprimus.py](gematriaprimus.py)
