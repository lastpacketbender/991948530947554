Ladies and Gentlemen of the Internet,

     I am why you cite your sources. It is said that a lie told often
enough becomes a truth; apparently, a troll repeated sufficiently becomes a
prophet. When the call to investigate first appeared on the internet, I
marveled at the psychological manipulation put into play by a true master
of the art; when the cicadas appeared around the world, I realized that I
was standing in the internet's most fertile ground for trickery. You were
so starved for clues you consumed my poison without question, and even when
you caught my lies, you continued to eagerly swallow. When you sought to
understand the identity of the puzzle I gave you closure by falsifying an
ARG; when you needed another text to give you insight I handed you
Neuromancer; when you wanted to know who wind was, I stole the name and
answered.

     Since the game is played out, I want to offer you some closure. I am,
after all, the only one who can tell you when it was I was truly trolling,
and when you misattributed my actions to those who gave out legitimate
information. Let me offer you a brief summary of my work.

I am Wind 3301.

I am MUTE.

I am Artemis.

I am 8.tk.

I am Wile E. Coyote.

I am the face in the onion.


I look forward to hearing from you.
