# ValÄ“te!

After a month of no communication from Cicada, another image was posted in [r/a2e7j6ic78h0j](../003-subreddit/README.md).

On February 6, 2012 11:27:05 PM the following image was posted to the subreddit by user CageThrottleUs which signaled an end of the puzzle. It is important to note - the moderator badge is now gone.

Hello.
  
We have now found the individuals we sought.   
Thus our month-long journey ends.     
       
For now.           
             
Thank you for your dedication and effort.  If you 
were unable to complete the test, or did not receive 
an email, do not despair.  
           
There will be more opportunities like this one.
       
Thank you all.

## Unused

There are two unused clues from this image.

### Whitespace

There is appended whitespace to this outguess message. My attempts to get a message out with `snow` (whitespace steganography tool) have proved to be futile. Other ideas may be book code locations, etc.

### Number

The number was also never used, following programming language/shell line continuations - this is likely just one full number.

`10412790658919985359827898739594318956404425106955675643739226952372682423852959081739834390370374475764863415203423499357108713631`

It factors into `99554414790940424414351515490472769096534141749790794321708050837` and `104593961812606247801193807142122161186583731774511103180935025763`.

See [factor.sh](../008-rsa-emails/factor.sh) for verification, prepare to wait a long time.

I've recreated a public/private key in the event this is another RSA key for later use. See [recreate-pk.pl](recreate-pk.pl), [numbers.private](numbers.private) (perl), [numbers.public](numbers.public) (perl), and [recreated.key](recreated.key) (armored version, created with [recreate-armor.py](recreate-armor.py)). There is also [attempt-pgp-recreation.sh](attempt-gpg-recreation.sh) using a tool called monkeysphere to import the RSA key to a PGP key, again failed.

```bash
$ ./monkeysphere/src/pem2openpgp "it worked" < recreated.pem | gpg2 --import --homedir temp_gpg/
RSA.xs:713: OpenSSL error: digest too big for rsa key at ./monkeysphere/src/pem2openpgp line 633, <STDIN> line 1.
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
```

This has been used for numerous trolls, notably "the game" decrypt found in an ideone page. 

What if Cicada wanted to increase the signal to noise ratio in its absence and pass along the tools to do it? :thinking-face:
