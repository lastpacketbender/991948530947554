# q4utgdi2n4m4uim5.onion

After solving the [columnar transposition cipher](../006-fourth-onion/README.md#outguess) from the 4th onion, solvers were led to this onion. See [q4utgdi2n4m4uim5.html](q4utgdi2n4m4uim5.html). It had a valid signature from Cicada.

## Hex

The hex turned to binary results in an [MP3 file](./q4utgdi2n4m4uim5.html.mp3). Not much else can be done with this at the time being.

## Onion goes down and comes back up

Like the previous onion, there was downtime. When it came back there was a portrait in the HTML.

You can see the sillhouette of Rasputin in the right hand side. XORing the image with the original reveals numbers and a cicada logo as well.
