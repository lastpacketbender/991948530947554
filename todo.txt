GPG decrypt RSA message twice
Rename everywhere.jpg/copy the other to all the different filenames
Other numbers found in IRC logs (either first onion or 8blahblah.com)
Are there numbers around for retrieval of the RSA challenge available? (check IRC, are they the same as the QR codes?)

Timeframe for when whitespace changed/sequencing of second-chance
